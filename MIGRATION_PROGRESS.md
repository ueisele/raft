# Test Migration Progress

## Completed

### Phase 1: Create Directory Structure ✓
- Created `integration/` directory with subdirectories for each test category
- Added README.md to integration directory

### Phase 2: Extract Integration-Specific Helpers ✓
- Created `integration/helpers/transport.go` with:
  - MultiNodeTransport
  - DebugTransport
  - PartitionableTransport
- Created `integration/helpers/cluster.go` with TestCluster utilities
- Created `integration/helpers/timing.go` with timing helpers
- Created `integration/helpers/assertions.go` with test assertions

### Phase 3: Split Mixed Test Files ✓
- Split `configuration_test.go`:
  - Unit test (TestConfigurationManager) remains in root
  - Integration test moved to `integration/configuration/changes_test.go`
- Split `safe_configuration_test.go`:
  - Unit test (TestCatchUpProgressCalculation) remains in root
  - Integration tests moved to `integration/configuration/safe_addition_test.go`

### Phase 4: Move Pure Integration Tests (Partially Complete)
- ✓ Moved `basic_test.go` → `integration/basic/basic_test.go`
- ✓ Split `integration_test.go` into:
  - `integration/cluster/election_test.go`
  - `integration/cluster/replication_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `membership_test.go` → `integration/cluster/membership_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `voting_safety_test.go` → `integration/safety/voting_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `safety_test.go` → `integration/safety/core_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `safety_extended_test.go` → `integration/safety/extended_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `leader_stability_test.go` → `integration/leadership/stability_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `leadership_transfer_test.go` → `integration/leadership/transfer_test.go`
- ✓ Merged `partition_test.go` + `partition_advanced_test.go` → `integration/fault_tolerance/partition_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `healing_test.go` → `integration/fault_tolerance/healing_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `persistence_integration_test.go` → `integration/fault_tolerance/persistence_test.go`
- ✓ Consolidated `client_*.go` files → `integration/client/interaction_test.go`

## Remaining Work

### Phase 4: Move Pure Integration Tests ✓ COMPLETED
- ✓ Moved `edge_cases_test.go` → `integration/stress/edge_cases_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `configuration_edge_test.go` → `integration/configuration/edge_cases_test.go`
- ✓ Moved `replication_extended_test.go` → `integration/cluster/replication_extended_test.go`
- Note: `snapshot_test.go` and `persistence_test.go` appear to be unit tests and will remain in root
- Note: `snapshot_advanced_test.go` was not found in the original files

### Phase 5: Update Imports
- Update all moved files to use proper imports
- Fix any remaining type references

### Phase 6: Verify Tests
- Run all unit tests: `go test .`
- Run all integration tests: `go test ./integration/...`
- Fix any compilation or runtime issues

### Phase 7: Clean Up
- Remove old test files that have been moved
- Update CI/CD configuration
- Update documentation

## Test Count Summary
- Original: 28 test files in root
- Target: ~10 unit test files in root + ~18 integration test files organized by category

## Notes
- Some tests use internal types and need careful refactoring
- Helper types have been exported (TestLogger, MockStateMachine, etc.)
- Transport implementations moved to integration helpers
- Need to be careful about import cycles
