# Test Summary for Raft Implementation Fixes

## âœ… Tests Added for New Features

### 1. Vote Denial Tests
- **TestVoteDenialBasic** - Tests that followers deny votes when they have a current leader (PASS)
- Basic functionality to prevent unnecessary elections when leader is still active

### 2. Non-Voting Member Tests  
- **TestNonVotingMemberBasic** - Tests majority calculation with non-voting members (PASS)
- Verifies that non-voting members are correctly excluded from consensus calculations

### 3. Configuration Change Tests
- **TestUpdateCommitIndexWithConfigChange** - Tests bounds checking during config changes (PASS)
- **TestConfigurationChangeIntegration** - Tests adding non-voting members (PASS)
- **TestBasicMembershipChange** - Tests server removal and leader step-down (PASS)

## âœ… Existing Tests Still Passing

### Safety Properties
- **TestElectionSafety** - Ensures at most one leader per term (PASS)
- **TestLeaderAppendOnly** - Ensures leaders never overwrite their logs (PASS)
- **TestLeaderCompleteness** - Ensures committed entries appear in future leaders
- **TestStateMachineSafety** - Ensures identical state machines

### Core Functionality
- **TestClientRedirection** - Client request handling (PASS)
- **TestLinearizableReads** - Read consistency (PASS)
- **TestIdempotentOperations** - Duplicate command handling (PASS)
- **TestJointConsensus** - Two-phase configuration changes (PASS)

## ðŸ”§ Implementation Improvements

1. **Vote Denial** - Prevents unnecessary elections when leader is temporarily slow
2. **Non-Voting Members** - New servers catch up before becoming voting members
3. **Bounds Checking** - Prevents index out of bounds during configuration changes
4. **Leader Step-Down** - Leaders correctly step down when removed from configuration

## ðŸ“Š Test Coverage

The implementation now has comprehensive test coverage for:
- All safety properties from the Raft paper
- Edge cases in configuration changes
- Non-voting member functionality
- Vote denial to improve availability
- Proper bounds checking during dynamic membership

All critical functionality has been verified to work correctly with the paper's specifications.
