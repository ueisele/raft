# Load Test Creation Summary

## Issue Discovered
While reviewing TEST_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md, we found that `integration/stress/load_test.go` was specified in the proposal but was missing from the actual implementation.

## Investigation
1. Checked existing test files for load-related tests
2. Found concurrent tests spread across multiple files:
   - `TestConcurrentMembershipChanges` in cluster/membership_test.go
   - `TestConcurrentClientRequests` in safety/extended_test.go  
   - `TestConcurrentSnapshotAndReplication` in snapshot/advanced_test.go
   - `TestConcurrentOperations` in stress/edge_cases_test.go

3. Checked git history - no previous load_test.go file was found
4. No benchmark tests were found in the codebase

## Solution
Created `integration/stress/load_test.go` with comprehensive load testing scenarios:

### Tests Added
1. **TestHighLoadSingleClient** - Tests system behavior under high load from a single client
   - Submits 1000 commands rapidly
   - Measures throughput
   - Verifies cluster health

2. **TestHighLoadMultipleClients** - Tests concurrent load from multiple clients
   - 10 concurrent clients
   - 100 commands per client
   - Tracks success/error rates

3. **TestSustainedLoad** - Tests system under sustained load over time
   - Runs for 10 seconds
   - Tracks throughput variations
   - Calculates min/max/average throughput

4. **TestLoadWithNodeFailures** - Tests load handling during node failures
   - Continues load while stopping nodes
   - Verifies availability with reduced cluster size

5. **TestLoadWithNetworkPartitions** - Tests load handling during network partitions
   - Creates and heals partitions while under load
   - Measures impact on throughput

## Benefits
1. **Comprehensive Coverage** - Now have dedicated load tests as specified in the proposal
2. **Performance Baseline** - Can measure throughput and identify performance regressions
3. **Stress Testing** - Can verify system behavior under extreme conditions
4. **Failure Scenarios** - Tests resilience under load combined with failures

## Test Organization
The `integration/stress/` directory now contains:
- `edge_cases_test.go` - Various edge cases and concurrent operations
- `load_test.go` - Dedicated high-load and performance scenarios

All tests compile successfully and follow the test structure proposal.
