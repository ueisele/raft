# Roadmap and Limitations

This document consolidates all known limitations, unimplemented features, and future work items for the Raft implementation.

## Major Unimplemented Features

### 1. Joint Consensus
**Status**: Not implemented by design  
**Impact**: High for safety during configuration changes  
**Details**: 
- Full two-phase joint consensus protocol not implemented
- Cannot safely change majority of cluster at once
- Must add/remove servers one at a time
- Alternative approach: Safe server addition with automatic promotion
- Reasoning: Adds significant complexity for limited benefit in practice

### 2. Configuration Rollback
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Medium - requires manual intervention  
**Details**:
- No automatic rollback of failed configuration changes
- Failed changes require administrator intervention
- No rollback mechanism specified in Raft paper

### 3. Leader Step-Down When Partitioned
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Medium - affects liveness  
**Details**:
- Partitioned leader continues believing it's leader without majority
- Cannot commit new entries but remains in leader state
- Should step down to follower when it can't reach majority

### 4. Replicated SafeConfigurationManager State
**Status**: Not implemented  
**Impact**: Medium - affects automatic promotions  
**Details**:
- Automatic promotion state is local to each node
- New leader doesn't know about pending promotions
- Promotion decisions are lost during leader changes

### 5. Automatic Promotion to Voting
**Status**: Partially implemented  
**Impact**: Low - logs intent but doesn't execute  
**Details**:
- Currently only logs when a server should be promoted
- Doesn't actually execute the promotion
- Requires manual intervention to complete

## Performance Limitations

### Current Limitations
1. **HTTP RPC Overhead**: May not be optimal for high-performance scenarios
2. **Basic Persistence**: Not optimized for large logs
3. **Replication Under Load**: 
   - Nodes may fall significantly behind under extreme load
   - Blocks new replication RPCs while one is in flight
   - Can cause large divergences in commit indices
4. **No Batching**: Commands processed individually
5. **No Pipelining**: Sequential processing of log entries

### Planned Optimizations
1. **gRPC Transport**: Better performance than HTTP
2. **Binary Persistence Format**: More efficient than JSON
3. **Batching**: Group multiple commands for efficiency
4. **Pipelining**: Reduce latency by overlapping operations
5. **Pre-vote Optimization**: Reduce disruptions from isolated nodes
6. **Leader Lease**: Enable local reads without consensus

## Security Gaps

### Current State
- **No Authentication**: Any node can join the cluster
- **No Encryption**: All communication is plaintext
- **No Authorization**: No access control for operations
- **No Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Assumes fail-stop model

### Required for Production
1. TLS encryption for all communication
2. Mutual authentication between nodes
3. Access control for client operations
4. Audit logging for security events

## Test Suite Status

### Current State
- **All tests passing**: 100% pass rate across ~120+ tests
- **Improved reliability**: Replaced ~350+ time.Sleep calls with proper synchronization
- **Well-organized**: Clear separation between unit and integration tests
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Tests cover all major Raft features

### Future Test Improvements
1. Add more stress tests for configuration changes
2. Add chaos engineering tests for failure scenarios
3. Add performance benchmarks for optimization tracking
4. Add fuzz testing for edge cases

## Documentation Status

### Existing Documentation
- **Architecture Overview**: Internal components and data flow (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Implementation Details**: Design decisions and internals (implementation/IMPLEMENTATION.md)
- **Test Optimization Guide**: Writing reliable distributed tests
- **Safe Server Addition**: Membership change best practices
- **Changelog**: Version history and recent changes

### Missing Documentation
1. **Operational Guide**: Day-to-day cluster management
2. **Complete API Documentation**: All public interfaces with examples
3. **Troubleshooting Guide**: Common issues and solutions
4. **Performance Tuning Guide**: Optimization strategies
5. **Production Deployment Guide**: Best practices for production use
