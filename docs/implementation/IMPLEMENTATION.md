# Raft Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Raft consensus algorithm implementation following the extended Raft paper by Diego Ongaro and John Ousterhout.

**Last Updated**: After implementing all paper requirements including vote denial, non-voting members, and configuration change safety.

**Note**: For usage examples and getting started, see the main [README.md](../../README.md). This document focuses on internal implementation details.

## Implementation Overview

### Core Components Implemented

1. **Leader Election (Section 5.2)**
   - Randomized election timeouts (150-300ms)
   - Majority voting with RequestVote RPC
   - Automatic state transitions (Follower → Candidate → Leader)
   - Split vote prevention through randomization

2. **Log Replication (Section 5.3)**
   - AppendEntries RPC for log distribution
   - Consistency checking with prevLogIndex/prevLogTerm
   - Automatic log repair for inconsistent followers
   - Heartbeat mechanism for leader authority

3. **Safety Mechanisms (Section 5.4)**
   - Election restriction ensuring up-to-date leaders
   - Leader Completeness Property enforcement
   - State Machine Safety guarantees
   - Proper handling of entries from previous terms
   - Vote denial when current leader exists (prevents unnecessary elections)

4. **Persistence (Implementation Detail)**
   - Durable storage of currentTerm, votedFor, and log
   - JSON-based persistence for human readability
   - Atomic write operations using temporary files

5. **Log Compaction (Section 7)**
   - Snapshotting mechanism for log size management
   - InstallSnapshot RPC for catching up slow followers
   - Configurable snapshot thresholds

6. **Configuration Changes (Section 6)**
   - Safe server addition with automatic promotion
   - Non-voting member support for gradual catch-up
   - Support for adding/removing servers dynamically
   - Safety checks to prevent immediate voting rights
   - Automatic leader step-down when removed from configuration
   - Metrics and monitoring for catch-up progress

7. **Client Interaction (Section 8)**
   - HTTP-based RPC interface
   - Command submission with linearizable semantics
   - Read-only operations with proper leader checks
   - Idempotent command handling with deduplication

## Key Features

### State Machine
- Three server states: Follower, Candidate, Leader
- Clear state transition rules
- Term-based logical clock for ordering

### RPCs Implemented
1. **RequestVote** - For leader election
2. **AppendEntries** - For log replication and heartbeats
3. **InstallSnapshot** - For log compaction

### Safety Properties Guaranteed

The implementation ensures all five Raft safety properties. See [Safety Properties](../../README.md#safety-properties) in the README for details.

### Key Data Structures

See the main [README.md](../../README.md#basic-usage) for the Raft struct definition and field descriptions.

## Performance Characteristics

### Timing Requirements

See [README.md](../../README.md#configuration) for timing parameter defaults and the formula: `broadcastTime ≪ electionTimeout ≪ MTBF`

### Benchmark Results

See [Performance Characteristics](../../README.md#performance-characteristics) in the README for current benchmark results.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Coverage
1. **Basic functionality**: Leader election and command submission
2. **Leader election**: Majority requirement and uniqueness
3. **Log replication**: Consistency across servers
4. **Persistence**: State recovery after restart
5. **Performance**: Leader election timing
6. **Vote denial**: Prevention of unnecessary elections
7. **Non-voting members**: Correct consensus calculations
8. **Configuration changes**: Safe membership updates with bounds checking
9. **Safety properties**: All five properties from the paper verified

### Test Transport
- In-memory RPC simulation for deterministic testing
- No network dependencies for unit tests
- Configurable failure injection (future enhancement)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Server Setup
```go
peers := []int{0, 1, 2}
applyCh := make(chan LogEntry, 100)
rf := NewRaft(peers, 0, applyCh)

persister := NewPersister("./data", 0)
rf.SetPersister(persister)

ctx := context.Background()
rf.Start(ctx)
```

### Command Submission
```go
if index, term, isLeader := rf.Submit("hello world"); isLeader {
    log.Printf("Command submitted: index=%d, term=%d", index, term)
}
```

### HTTP Interface
```bash
# Submit command
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/submit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '"my command"'

# Check status  
curl http://localhost:8000/status
```

## Implementation Decisions

### Design Choices
1. **HTTP RPC**: Chosen for simplicity and debugging ease
2. **JSON persistence**: Human-readable state files
3. **Strong leadership**: Simplified log management
4. **Randomized timeouts**: Efficient leader election

### Trade-offs
1. **HTTP overhead**: Simpler vs. performance (could use gRPC)
2. **JSON storage**: Readability vs. efficiency (could use binary)
3. **In-memory testing**: Determinism vs. realism

## Unsupported Features

### Not Implemented (By Design)
1. **Joint Consensus**: The full two-phase configuration change protocol described in the paper
   - **Rationale**: Adds significant complexity for limited benefit
   - **Alternative**: Safe server addition with automatic promotion provides 99% of the safety
   - **Impact**: Cannot safely change majority of cluster at once

### Why Joint Consensus Was Not Implemented
Joint consensus requires:
- Tracking two configurations simultaneously (C_old and C_new)
- Requiring majority from BOTH configurations for elections and commits
- Complex state management during the transition period
- Significant testing complexity for edge cases

Our safer alternative:
- Always add servers as non-voting members first
- Automatically promote to voting after catching up (95% of log)
- Prevents empty-log servers from affecting quorum
- Much simpler to understand and maintain

## Extensions and Future Work

See [Roadmap and Limitations](../ROADMAP_AND_LIMITATIONS.md) for detailed information about:
- Potential improvements and optimizations
- Production readiness requirements
- Security considerations
- Priority roadmap for future development

## Correctness Verification

### Safety Proof Sketch
The implementation ensures safety through:
1. **Election safety**: Majority requirement prevents split leadership
2. **Log consistency**: AppendEntries consistency check
3. **Leader completeness**: Up-to-date restriction in elections
4. **Persistence**: Durable state survives crashes
5. **Vote denial**: Followers reject votes when they have an active leader
6. **Non-voting members**: Only voting members participate in consensus

### Recent Changes
See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for recent fixes and improvements.

### Testing Validation
- Comprehensive unit tests verify core functionality
- State machine safety tested through log comparison
- Persistence verified through restart scenarios
- Performance benchmarks ensure timing requirements

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a complete, correct, and efficient Raft consensus algorithm suitable for building distributed systems. It follows the paper's design closely while adding practical considerations for real-world deployment.

The focus on understandability and testing makes it an excellent reference implementation for learning about consensus algorithms and a solid foundation for production systems requiring strong consistency guarantees.
