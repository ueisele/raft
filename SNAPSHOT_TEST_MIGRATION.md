# Snapshot Test Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully completed the migration of snapshot tests to align with the test structure proposal in TEST_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created integration/snapshot/ directory
- `advanced_test.go` - Advanced snapshot integration tests (8 tests)
- `basic_test.go` - Basic snapshot integration tests (4 tests)

### 2. Created snapshot_manager_test.go
- Unit tests for snapshot functionality
- Tests empty snapshot, large snapshot, and basic snapshot manager operations

### 3. Removed old snapshot_test.go
- Migrated all tests to appropriate locations
- Integration tests moved to integration/snapshot/
- Unit tests moved to snapshot_manager_test.go

## Test Organization

### Unit Tests (snapshot_manager_test.go)
- TestEmptySnapshot
- TestLargeSnapshot  
- TestSnapshotManagerBasics

### Integration Tests - Basic (integration/snapshot/basic_test.go)
- TestSnapshotCreation
- TestSnapshotInstallation
- TestSnapshotWithConcurrentWrites
- TestSnapshotFailure

### Integration Tests - Advanced (integration/snapshot/advanced_test.go)
- TestSnapshotDuringPartition
- TestSnapshotDuringLeadershipChange
- TestSnapshotOfSnapshotIndex
- TestConcurrentSnapshotAndReplication
- TestSnapshotInstallationRaceConditions
- TestPersistenceWithRapidSnapshots
- TestSnapshotTransmissionFailure

## Key Updates

1. **Removed TriggerSnapshot calls**: Tests now rely on automatic snapshot creation based on MaxLogSize configuration
2. **Added WithMaxLogSize helper**: New cluster configuration option to control snapshot triggering
3. **Fixed import cycles**: Used integration test helpers properly
4. **Updated TestCluster**: Added tracking for persistence and state machines

## Benefits

1. **Clear separation**: Unit tests vs integration tests are now clearly separated
2. **Better organization**: Snapshot tests grouped by complexity (basic vs advanced)
3. **Improved maintainability**: Related tests are together, making them easier to find and update
4. **Follows Go conventions**: Unit tests remain in root directory alongside implementation

## Verification

All tests compile successfully:
- Unit tests: `go test -c .`
- Integration tests: `go test -c ./integration/...`
