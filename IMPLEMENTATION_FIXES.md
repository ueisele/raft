# Raft Implementation Fixes

This document summarizes the fixes applied to ensure the Raft implementation follows the paper's specifications.

## 1. Vote Denial for Current Leader (Fixed)
**Issue**: The implementation didn't deny votes when a current leader exists within the election timeout.
**Fix**: Added check in `RequestVote()` to deny votes if we've heard from a leader within the minimum election timeout.
- File: `raft.go`, lines 825-830
- This prevents unnecessary elections when the leader is still active

## 2. Non-Voting Member Support (Fixed)
**Issue**: Configuration changes didn't support adding servers as non-voting members first.
**Fix**: Enhanced `AddServer()` to:
- First add new servers as non-voting members
- Wait for them to catch up with the leader's log
- Then promote them to voting members using joint consensus
- File: `config.go`, lines 70-110

## 3. Voting Member Handling (Fixed)
**Issue**: Non-voting members were counted in elections and commit calculations.
**Fix**: 
- Added `isVotingMember()` helper function
- Updated election logic to skip non-voting members
- Updated commit index calculations to only count voting members
- Updated `getMajoritySize()` to only count voting members
- Files: `config.go` and `raft.go`

## 4. Commit Index Logic (Verified Correct)
The implementation correctly follows the paper's requirement that leaders can only commit entries from previous terms by committing an entry from their current term.

## 5. Snapshot Handling (Verified Correct)
The snapshot implementation correctly retains non-conflicting log entries after the snapshot point, as specified in the paper.

## Summary of Changes:
1. Enhanced election safety by preventing unnecessary leader changes
2. Improved configuration change safety with non-voting member support
3. Correctly implemented voting member distinction for consensus calculations
4. All safety properties from the paper are now properly enforced
