# Todo List Completion Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Document replication_extended_test.go
- **Issue**: The file `integration/cluster/replication_extended_test.go` existed but wasn't documented in TEST_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md
- **Solution**: Updated TEST_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md to include this file in the cluster directory structure
- **Rationale**: The file contains valuable extended replication tests with failure scenarios that should be kept

### 2. Migrate TestUpdateCommitIndexWithConfigChange
- **Issue**: The test `TestUpdateCommitIndexWithConfigChange` from `backup/raft_fixes_test.go` was not found in the current test structure
- **Solution**: Created new file `integration/configuration/bounds_check_test.go` with two tests:
  - `TestCommitIndexBoundsWithConfigChange` - Tests commit index updates after reducing cluster size
  - `TestMatchIndexBoundsAfterConfigChange` - Tests matchIndex bounds checking after configuration changes
- **Rationale**: These tests ensure proper bounds checking when accessing arrays after configuration changes, preventing potential panics

## Final Test Structure Status

The test structure now fully aligns with TEST_STRUCTURE_PROPOSAL.md with these additions:
- `integration/cluster/replication_extended_test.go` - Documented in proposal
- `integration/configuration/bounds_check_test.go` - New file for bounds checking tests

All tests compile successfully and the migration is complete.
