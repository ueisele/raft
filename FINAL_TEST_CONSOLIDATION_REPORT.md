- ✅ **vote_denial_test.go** → Merged into `voting_safety_test.go`

### 2. Multi-Node Tests (2 → 0)

2. **node_test.go**
3. **state_test.go**
4. **log_test.go**
5. **election_test.go**
6. **replication_test.go**
7. **snapshot_test.go**

### Extended/Advanced Tests (4 files)
8. **replication_extended_test.go**
9. **snapshot_advanced_test.go**
10. **safety_extended_test.go**
11. **partition_advanced_test.go**

### Safety and Correctness Tests (3 files)
12. **safety_test.go**
13. **voting_safety_test.go** (consolidated 4 files into this)
14. **leader_stability_test.go**

### Configuration and Membership Tests (5 files)
15. **configuration_test.go**
16. **configuration_edge_test.go**
17. **safe_configuration_test.go**
18. **membership_test.go**
19. **leadership_transfer_test.go**

### Fault Tolerance Tests (4 files)
20. **partition_test.go**
21. **healing_test.go** (includes healing_eventual_test.go)
22. **persistence_test.go**
23. **persistence_integration_test.go**

### Client and Integration Tests (4 files)
24. **client_example_test.go**
25. **client_extended_test.go**
26. **client_interaction_test.go**
27. **integration_test.go**

### Edge Cases (1 file)
28. **edge_cases_test.go**

## Missing from Original Consolidation Plan

1. **vote_denial_test.go** - This file contains 3 important tests about vote denial behavior and was not included in the voting safety consolidation. It has now been successfully merged into voting_safety_test.go.

## Verification of Test Count

### Before Consolidation
From test_categories.md: 35 test files

### After Consolidation
Current count: 28 test files

### Removed Files (7)
1. voting_safety_demo_test.go
2. voting_member_safety_analysis_test.go
3. vote_denial_test.go
4. multi_node_test.go
5. debug_multi_test.go
6. healing_eventual_test.go
7. replication_snapshot_test.go

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Consolidated **vote_denial_test.go** into **voting_safety_test.go**

### Future Consolidation Opportunities
1. **Safety Tests**: Merge safety_extended_test.go into safety_test.go
2. **Partition Tests**: Merge partition_advanced_test.go into partition_test.go
3. **Replication Tests**: Merge replication_extended_test.go into replication_test.go
4. **Client Tests**: Consolidate 3 client test files into 2
5. **Configuration Tests**: Consolidate 3 configuration test files into 2

### Test Coverage
- All test scenarios from removed files have been preserved
- Helper functions moved to test_helpers.go
- No loss of test coverage despite file reduction
