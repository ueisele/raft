### 6. Client and Integration Tests
- **client_example_test.go** - Client API examples
- **client_extended_test.go** - Extended client scenarios
- **client_interaction_test.go** - Client interaction patterns
- **integration_test.go** - Full integration tests

### 7. Edge Cases
- **edge_cases_test.go** - Various edge cases

## Files Already Consolidated/Removed
1. ✅ **voting_safety_demo_test.go** → voting_safety_test.go
2. ✅ **voting_member_safety_analysis_test.go** → voting_safety_test.go
3. ✅ **multi_node_test.go** → removed (covered by integration_test.go)
4. ✅ **debug_multi_test.go** → removed (helpers moved to test_helpers.go)
5. ✅ **healing_eventual_test.go** → healing_test.go
6. ✅ **replication_snapshot_test.go** → snapshot_advanced_test.go

## Additional Consolidation Opportunities

### 1. Vote Denial Tests
**vote_denial_test.go** could potentially be merged with:
- **voting_safety_test.go** - Both test voting-related safety
- **election_test.go** - Vote denial is part of election process

### 2. Safety Tests
Consider consolidating:
- **safety_test.go**
- **safety_extended_test.go**
Into one comprehensive safety test file

### 3. Partition Tests
Consider consolidating:
- **partition_test.go**
- **partition_advanced_test.go**
Into one comprehensive partition test file

### 4. Client Tests
Consider consolidating:
- **client_example_test.go**
- **client_extended_test.go**
- **client_interaction_test.go**
Into one or two client test files

### 5. Configuration Tests
Consider consolidating:
- **configuration_test.go**
- **configuration_edge_test.go**
- **safe_configuration_test.go**
Into one or two configuration test files

### 6. Persistence Tests
Keep separate as they test different aspects:
- **persistence_test.go** - Single node persistence
- **persistence_integration_test.go** - Multi-node crash scenarios

### 7. Replication Tests
Consider consolidating:
- **replication_test.go**
- **replication_extended_test.go**
Into one comprehensive replication test file

## Recommended Consolidation Plan

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Low Risk)
1. **Vote Denial** → Merge vote_denial_test.go into voting_safety_test.go
2. **Safety Tests** → Merge safety_extended_test.go into safety_test.go
3. **Partition Tests** → Merge partition_advanced_test.go into partition_test.go
4. **Replication Tests** → Merge replication_extended_test.go into replication_test.go

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Medium Risk)
5. **Client Tests** → Consolidate 3 files into 2:
   - client_test.go (examples and basic interactions)
   - client_advanced_test.go (extended scenarios)
6. **Configuration Tests** → Consolidate 3 files into 2:
   - configuration_test.go (basic + edge cases)
   - safe_configuration_test.go (keep separate for clarity)

### Tests to Keep Separate
- **edge_cases_test.go** - Miscellaneous edge cases
- **leader_stability_test.go** - Specific stability scenarios
- **leadership_transfer_test.go** - Specific feature tests
- **membership_test.go** - Distinct from configuration
- **integration_test.go** - High-level integration tests
- All core component tests (basic, node, state, log, election, snapshot)

## Expected Outcome
- Current: 29 test files
- After Phase 1: 25 test files (-4)
- After Phase 2: 22 test files (-7 total, 24% reduction)

## Test Coverage Verification
Before consolidation, ensure:
1. Count tests in each file to be consolidated
2. Verify no unique scenarios are lost
3. Check for test-specific helpers that need preservation
4. Run coverage analysis before and after
